        <h3>THIS is MY WORD</h3>

        <p>
          All of us are similar, but each of us is different. It's these
          differences that make us unique individuals. It's up to you to
          discover your strengths (and weaknesses), to figure out what's
          important to you, to plot your own course through this world. Taking
          time periodically to re-asses what makes you tick is an essential part
          of building a life that allows you to flourish. Love yourself. All my
          life, I've struggled with low self-esteem. There have been times when
          I've hated myself. Recent years have been especially tough for me as
          anxiety and depression proved to be crippling for months on end.
          Working with a therapist helped. She helped me to understand that it's
          important to learn to both accept myself and love myself — even
          though, like everyone, I'm imperfect. I still have a long way to go,
          but I'm making progress. Self-care comes first. If you're not healthy,
          it's tough to be happy. Before you can take care of your friends and
          your family, you need to take care of yourself. Eat well. Exercise.
          Nurture your mind, body, and spirit. Your body is a temple; treat it
          like one. If you don't have your health, you've got nothing.
